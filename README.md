# Tutorial on 'Ruby on Rails'

## "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Setting it up on your machine

1. Have Ruby on Rails set up. I suppose you can find a number of guides on how to do that. I've found the one over there helpful: [http://guides.railsgirls.com/install](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install).
2. Get a copy of the repository, on your machine: `git clone https://github.com/phtan/ror-tutorial`
3. Enter the directory-structure: `cd ror-tutorial`
4. Start the app up: `rails server`
0. Browse to the address **http://0.0.0.0:3000/**, in your chosen web-browser.
